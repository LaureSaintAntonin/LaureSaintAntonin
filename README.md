## Hello World !

- 👋 I'm @LaureSaintAntonin, and I'm an apprentice full-stack developer ! Currently,
I'm looking to find a job contract shared between work and school @adatechschool to
continue my learning (March 2024 (-> Mars 2025), 4 days at work / 1 day at school).

- 👀 Before coding, I was working in an medical emergency call center,
but I have decided to update my life for the coming years.

- 💞️ I'm a single mum, very busy obviously, but I like to be challenged.

- 💻 You'll find my different projects in these repositories. But I'm still a
newbie, so be kind please because my projects could be
imperfect and may not be secure. 

- 📫 You can reach me on my LinkedIn 😉
        

Thank you 😀

Laure
