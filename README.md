## Hello World !

- 👋 I'm @LaureSaintAntonin, and i'm an apprentice fullstack developper ! Currently,
i'm looking to find a job contrat shared between job and school @adatechschool to
continu my learning (March 2024, 4days / 1 day).

- 👀 Before coding, I was working in an medical emergency call center, 
but I decided to update my life for the next years. 

- 💞️ I'm a single mum, very busy obviously, but I like to be challenged. 

- 💻 You'll find my different projects in these repo. But I'm stilling
newbie, so be kind please because my projects could be
imperfect and maybe not well secure. 

- 📫 You can reach me on my

Thank you 😀
Laure
